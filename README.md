# Graphics Programming

A series of labs completed in association with the course PROG2002 at NTNU.

### How to build

Configure:
```bash
cmake -G Ninja -S . -B build/
```

Build:
```bash
cmake --build build/
```

Tests:
```bash
cmake --build build/ --target tests
```

Docs:
```bash
cmake --build build/ --target docs
```

To build the user must have the following libraries available for cmake to discover: GLFW3, GLEW, GLM and native OpenGL headers.

### Using vcpkg

[Vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) is a ports like package manager for libraries that is the closest to a sane way of obtaining dependencies on Windows.

Install vcpkg:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg
.\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat -disableMetrics
.\vcpkg integrate install
```

The last command above gives you a cmake variable. Pass it to cmake as such:
```bash
cmake -G Ninja -S . -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="C:\path\to\vcpkg.cmake"
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
.\vcpkg install glfw3 glm glew catch imgui 'imgui[glfw-binding]' stb opengl
```
